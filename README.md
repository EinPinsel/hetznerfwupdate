# Hetzner Firewall Manager

This script updates a Hetzner Robot Firewall Rule with your current target, e.g. in DynDNS Setups. 

It is a very rough thing that works for me - your usecase might be different. Use with care. 

## Installation & Usage

For convinience there is a setup routine for Windows and Python. 
After that, activate the venv
On macOS/Linux:
   `source venv/bin/activate`
   # On Windows:
   `.\venv\Scripts\activate`


Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
